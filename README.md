## Docker 101
This is a challenge repository! You must:

1. Containerize a Python application using alpine as base image.
2. Dockerfile must be as modular as possible.
3. Customize entrypoint.sh (notice difference between `RUN` and `CMD`).
4. Mount a volume to store results locally so that data is persisted.
5. Have fun ;-)
